# Actorle Movie Title Helper
This simple extension makes it easy to convert a movie title to a series of X's (thus making it easier to search the webpage for a given movie title).

## What is Actorle?
 - https://actorle.com/ is a little game inspired by wordle.
 - You're given a list of movies, with each title "redacted", so that each letter is replaced by an X.
 - You try to guess which actor is in every movie.
 - Actorle has nothing to do with me; I just wrote this little extension.

## How Does This Extension Work?
It's pretty simple so far. It just lets you type in any string, and replaces letters and numbers with X's.
